# php_crud
This is my first work using PHP as main tool for build an app. In this case, I made a mini POS system, where you can register a product, gave a description, and assign a category. You can also edit and delete each entry you register before, as well as searching for a product in database. <br> <br>
Besides, you can export all data to CSV format or xls for Excel, and copy it to the clipboard.
All frontend design was made with template, got from ThemeForest. You can buy from there every design do you want, and adapt it for your own projects. <br><br>
Because of all entries are saved into a cloud database, all of this can be consulted and modified from wherever you want, and all data always will be available from any device.
Made with MVC pattern. <br> <br>

<li>HTML</li>
